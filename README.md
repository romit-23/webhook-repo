# GitHub Webhook Receiver - Developer Assessment Submission

**Candidate Submission for Developer Assessment Task**

This is my implementation of the GitHub webhook receiver system as per the assessment requirements. The application successfully captures GitHub repository events (Push, Pull Request, Merge) from my demo `action-repo` and displays them in a real-time UI with MongoDB storage.

## üìã Project Overview

This application receives GitHub webhooks for repository events and stores them in MongoDB. The UI polls the database every 15 seconds to display the latest repository activities in a clean, formatted manner.

### Supported GitHub Events:
- **PUSH**: `{author} pushed to {branch} on {timestamp}`
- **PULL_REQUEST**: `{author} submitted a pull request from {from_branch} to {to_branch} on {timestamp}`
- **MERGE**: `{author} merged branch {from_branch} to {to_branch} on {timestamp}`

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- MongoDB (local installation)
- Git

### 1. Clone and Setup Virtual Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-webhook-repo-url>
cd webhook-repo

# Create virtual environment
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup MongoDB

#### Install MongoDB:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install mongodb

# macOS
brew install mongodb-community

# Start MongoDB service
sudo systemctl start mongod  # Linux
brew services start mongodb-community  # macOS
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/app-flow.png" alt="Connect Database" />
</p>


### 4. Run the Application

```bash
# Start the Flask application
python run.py
```

The application will be available at: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## üîó API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `/webhook/` | GET | Main UI displaying recent events |
| `/webhook/receiver` | POST | GitHub webhook receiver endpoint |
| `/webhook/events` | GET | JSON API for latest events |
| `/webhook/debug/db-info` | GET | Database connection info (debug) |
| `/webhook/debug/raw-events` | GET | Raw events from database (debug) |

## üîß GitHub Webhook Configuration

### 1. In your action-repo repository (already configured):
**My demo repository**: `https://github.com/[your-username]/action-repo`

The webhook is already set up in my action-repo with the following configuration:
1. **Payload URL**: `https://[your-ngrok-url].ngrok.io/webhook/receiver`
2. **Content type**: `application/json`
3. **Events**: Pushes, Pull requests (configured for all required events)
4. **Status**: Active ‚úÖ

To test the implementation:
- Any push, pull request, or merge action on my `action-repo` will trigger the webhook
- Events will be captured, stored in MongoDB, and displayed in the UI

### 2. For local development with ngrok:
```bash
# Install ngrok
# Download from: https://ngrok.com/download

# Expose local Flask app
ngrok http 5000

# Use the generated HTTPS URL for GitHub webhook
# Example: https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook/receiver
```

## üóÑÔ∏è MongoDB Schema

Events are stored in the `github_events` database with the following schema:

```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "request_id": "commit_id_or_pr_number",
  "author": "github_username",
  "action": "PUSH|PULL_REQUEST|MERGE",
  "from_branch": "source_branch_name",
  "to_branch": "target_branch_name", 
  "timestamp": "ISO_8601_timestamp"
}
```

## üñ•Ô∏è UI Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Polls MongoDB every 15 seconds
- **Clean Display**: Shows latest 10 repository events
- **Formatted Messages**: Human-readable event descriptions
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Auto-refresh**: No manual refresh needed

## üß™ Testing the Implementation

### Demonstration Steps:
1. **Start the application**: `python run.py`
2. **Setup ngrok**: `ngrok http 5000` (webhook URL already configured in action-repo)
3. **Visit UI**: `http://localhost:5000/webhook/`
4. **Trigger events**: Perform actions on my `action-repo` (push commits, create PRs, merge branches)
5. **Observe results**: Watch real-time updates appear in the UI every 15 seconds

### Example Event Outputs:
- **Push**: "john-doe pushed to main on 3 June 2025 - 9:30 PM UTC"
- **Pull Request**: "john-doe submitted a pull request from feature-branch to main on 3 June 2025 - 9:00 AM UTC"  
- **Merge**: "john-doe merged branch feature-branch to main on 3 June 2025 - 12:00 PM UTC"

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Issues:
```bash
# Check MongoDB status
sudo systemctl status mongod

# Check if port 27017 is open
netstat -an | grep 27017

# View MongoDB logs
sudo journalctl -u mongod
```

### Webhook Not Receiving Data:
- Verify ngrok is running and URL is correct
- Check GitHub webhook delivery logs
- Ensure firewall allows incoming connections
- Check Flask application logs

### UI Not Updating:
- Verify JavaScript console for errors
- Check MongoDB has events: `db.events.find()`
- Ensure `/webhook/events` endpoint returns data

## üìù Development Notes

### Key Files:
- `app/webhook/routes.py`: Main webhook logic and event formatting
- `app/extensions.py`: MongoDB configuration
- `app/templates/index.html`: UI template with auto-refresh
- `run.py`: Flask application entry point

### Event Processing Flow:
1. GitHub sends webhook to `/webhook/receiver`
2. Flask processes event and extracts relevant data
3. Event stored in MongoDB with standardized schema
4. UI polls `/webhook/events` every 15 seconds
5. New events displayed in formatted list

## üöÄ Production Deployment

For production deployment, consider:

```bash
# Use Gunicorn instead of Flask dev server
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 run:app

# Use production MongoDB instance
# Update MONGO_URI in app configuration

# Set up proper logging and monitoring
# Configure reverse proxy (nginx) for HTTPS
```

**Candidate Note**: This submission demonstrates my proficiency in Flask development, MongoDB integration, webhook handling, and real-time web applications. The code is production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and documentation. I'm excited about the opportunity to discuss this implementation and how it showcases my development skills for this role.
